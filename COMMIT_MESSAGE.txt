feat: Implement HTTPS/HTTP/2 with Caddy and Docker setup

Core Changes (16 points):

1. Docker Setup
   - Add Dockerfile for multi-stage Rust build (ingest-server)
   - Add Dockerfile.caddy for Caddy reverse proxy
   - Add docker-compose.yml with 2 services (ingest-server + caddy)
   - Add docker-run.sh helper script for one-command setup
   - Add .dockerignore for optimized builds

2. Caddy Integration
   - Add Caddyfile for HTTPS/HTTP/2 reverse proxy
   - Configure self-signed TLS for localhost development
   - Automatic WebSocket upgrade support
   - Port 3090 (HTTPS/HTTP/2) external, 3091 (HTTP) internal

3. Producer Updates
   - Default to HTTPS (USE_HTTPS=true)
   - Support SSL verification toggle (VERIFY_SSL)
   - Auto-detect protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) from configuration
   - Update .env.example with HTTPS configuration
   - Enhanced logging with protocol and SSL status

4. Web Client Updates
   - Default WebSocket URL: wss://localhost:3090
   - WebSocket URL normalization to prevent duplication
   - Support both WSS (HTTPS) and WS (HTTP) protocols
   - Improved placeholder text with protocol options

5. Health Check Endpoint
   - Add GET / and GET /health endpoints
   - Return JSON with service status, version, active streams
   - Display total WebSocket connections
   - List available endpoints

6. Error Handling Improvements
   - Change channel closed error from 500 to 202 Accepted
   - Better handling when no WebSocket clients connected
   - Producer no longer receives 500 errors during startup

7. Configuration Management
   - Add .env.example for ingest-server
   - Update producer .env.example with HTTPS options
   - Environment variable precedence handling
   - Explicit .env file path resolution

8. Port Configuration
   - Ingest server: Port 3091 (internal, behind Caddy)
   - Caddy: Port 3090 (external, HTTPS/HTTP/2)
   - Web client server: Port 3092 (unchanged)
   - Update all default configurations

9. Documentation Updates
   - Add README.docker.md with Docker setup guide
   - Update main README.md with HTTPS/HTTP/2 instructions
   - Update producer README.md with Docker/Caddy setup
   - Update web-client README.md with WSS configuration
   - Add troubleshooting sections for HTTPS

10. Rust Code Updates
    - Update Rust version to 1.82 (support Cargo.lock v4)
    - Add serde_json dependency for JSON responses
    - Improve error handling in http_ingest_handler
    - Better status code handling (202 vs 500)

11. Script Improvements
    - Update run.sh with Caddy support
    - Add setup-caddy.sh for Caddy installation
    - Add docker-run.sh for Docker workflow
    - Make all scripts executable

12. Network Architecture
    - Docker network: broker-network (bridge)
    - Service discovery: ingest-server:3091 (internal)
    - Volume persistence for Caddy data/config
    - Health checks for both services

13. Security Enhancements
    - TLS termination at Caddy layer
    - Self-signed certificates for development
    - SSL verification toggle for producers
    - Non-root user in Docker containers

14. Performance Optimizations
    - HTTP/2 enabled by default in Caddy
    - Connection reuse with keep-alive
    - Efficient reverse proxy configuration
    - Health check monitoring

15. Developer Experience
    - One-command Docker setup (docker compose up -d)
    - Clear error messages and logging
    - Comprehensive documentation
    - Example configuration files

16. Production Readiness
    - Support for Let's Encrypt certificates
    - Scalable architecture (separate containers)
    - Health check endpoints for monitoring
    - Graceful error handling

Breaking Changes:
- Default producer now uses HTTPS (port 3090) instead of HTTP
- Ingest server default port changed to 3091 (internal)
- Web client default WebSocket URL changed to WSS

Migration Guide:
- Update producer .env: USE_HTTPS=true, BROKER_PORT=3090
- Update web client: Use wss://localhost:3090/ws/stream1
- For direct HTTP: USE_HTTPS=false, BROKER_PORT=3091
